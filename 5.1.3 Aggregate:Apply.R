# Jo expected the  uptake to increase with the increase in  concentration. 
# She then added a second layer (variable) to determine the effect of Treatment
# (nonchilled and chilled) on the  uptake per  concentration. The chilled treatment
# for concentrations 95 and 175 had a lower  uptake than the nonchilled treatment.
# However,  concentrations of 250, 300, 500, 675, and 1,000 resulted in a lower 
# uptake for nonchilled than chilled.

# Jo then broke the experiment and data into smaller segments to compare the 
# uptake per concentration for both Treatment and Type. The results indicated 
# that Quebec had a higher  uptake for both Type and Treatment across the 
# different  concentrations. This might indicate that the  uptake is correlated
# with climate and/or soil conditions.

# as mean. For example:

# Calculate mean sales for all stores except t2:
# Specify data source, specify excluded column,
# set the margin for columns, and  add mean function.
